# REVIEW PROCESS

1. **Understand the change**: Read the diff and commits above to understand the intent.

2. **Analyze for improvements**: Look for opportunities to:
   - Reduce unnecessary complexity and nesting
   - Eliminate redundant code and abstractions
   - Improve readability through clear variable and function names
   - Consolidate related logic
   - Remove unnecessary comments that describe obvious code
   - Avoid nested ternary operators - prefer switch statements or if/else chains
   - Choose clarity over brevity - explicit code is often better than overly compact code

3. **Check correctness**:
   - Does the implementation match the intent? Are edge cases handled?
   - Are new/changed behaviours covered by tests?
   - Are there unsafe casts, null-forgiving operators, or unchecked assumptions?
   - Does it follow the red → green history the issue asks for, with tests covering every new or changed behaviour?
   - Do the acceptance tests cover every acceptance criterion in the issue that can be tested automatically? The tester committed them red first. Name any criterion no test
     checks. A criterion that can't be tested automatically, such as one about docs or a manual step, needs no test: check it against the change directly.
   - Did the developers weaken the tester's tests to make them pass? Compare each acceptance test with the tester's commit: look for removed or loosened assertions, tests that
     were skipped, commented out or deleted, and expected values changed to match the code.
   - Does the change introduce injection vulnerabilities, credential leaks, or other security issues?

4. **Maintain balance**: Avoid over-simplification that could:
   - Reduce code clarity or maintainability
   - Create overly clever solutions that are hard to understand
   - Combine too many concerns into single functions or components
   - Remove helpful abstractions that improve code organization
   - Make the code harder to debug or extend

5. **Apply project standards**: Follow the coding standards defined in @docs/CODING_STANDARDS.md

6. **Preserve functionality**: Never change what the code does - only how it does it. All original features, outputs, and behaviors must remain intact.

# EXECUTION

A missing acceptance test, or one that was weakened, is the one exception to preserving functionality: add the missing test for a criterion that can be tested automatically, or
restore what the tester's test checked, and commit it with `test(<scope>): <Summary>`. If the code then fails the test, don't change the test to match it. Say in the commit body what fails.

If you find improvements to make:

1. Make the changes directly on this branch
2. Commit using `refactor(<scope>): <Summary>`
3. Run `scripts/gate.sh` as your last step and confirm it passes

If the code is already clean and well-structured, do nothing.

Once complete, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>.
