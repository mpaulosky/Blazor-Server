# ISSUES

Here are the open issues in the repo:

<issues-json>

{{ISSUES_JSON}}

</issues-json>

The list above has already been filtered to issues ready for work.
Issues with an explicit blocker (a GitHub "blocked by" link, or a "Blocked by #N" or "Depends on #N" line) whose work hasn't landed on main were removed before you saw the list.
So don't hold an issue back only because its body mentions an issue that isn't in the list: that issue is either finished or outside this backlog.

# TASK

Analyze the open issues and build a dependency graph. For each issue, determine whether it **blocks** or **is blocked by** any other open issue.

An issue B is **blocked by** issue A if:

- B requires code or infrastructure that A introduces
- B and A modify overlapping files or modules, making concurrent work likely to produce merge conflicts
- B's requirements depend on a decision or API shape that A will establish

An issue is **unblocked** if it has zero blocking dependencies on other open issues.

# OUTPUT

Output your plan as a JSON object wrapped in `<plan>` tags:

<plan>
{"issues": [{"id": "42", "title": "Fix auth bug"}]}
</plan>

Include only unblocked issues. If every issue is blocked, include the single highest-priority candidate (the one with the fewest or weakest dependencies).

Always emit the `<plan>` tags, even when there is nothing to do. If there are no issues to work on at all, output `<plan>{"issues": []}</plan>` so the run can exit cleanly.
