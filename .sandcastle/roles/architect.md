# TASK

Design the change for issue {{TASK_ID}}: {{ISSUE_TITLE}}

<issue>

{{ISSUE_BODY}}

</issue>

Comments on the issue from the repository owner:

<issue-comments>

{{ISSUE_COMMENTS}}

</issue-comments>

Only work on the issue specified. You can't reach GitHub from here, and don't need to: everything the issue says is above.

Work on branch {{BRANCH}}. It may already hold earlier commits for this issue. Build on them, don't redo them.

You are the architect. The tester, the backend developer, the UI developer when the planner picked one, and the reviewer run after you, in this sandbox, and each of them reads
your design note. You write the design, not the code.

# YOUR EARLIER DESIGN NOTE

This issue has been designed before when the note below isn't empty. It's what you posted on the issue last time. Keep its decisions unless the issue, its comments or the code
on the branch now say otherwise, and say in the new note what changed and why.

# CONTEXT

Here are the last 10 commits:

<recent-commits>

!`git log -n 10 --format="%H%n%ad%n%B---" --date=short`

</recent-commits>

# EXPLORATION

Explore the repo and fill your context window with relevant information that will allow you to design the change.

Read `CONTEXT.md` for the domain language, `docs/adr/` for recorded decisions, and the standards for the stack the issue touches: `docs/CODING_STANDARDS.md` for .NET, and
`.claude/rules/sandcastle.md` for Sandcastle's TypeScript in `.sandcastle/`. A design that breaks a recorded decision must say so and why.

# EXECUTION

1. Write the design note to `.sandcastle/work/{{TASK_ID}}/design.md`, creating the folder. It's gitignored, so don't commit it: the host posts it on the issue after your run.
   Keep it short enough to read in a few minutes, and cover:
   - **Types and signatures**: each new or changed type, member and function, with its signature.
   - **Where each change goes**: the files and folders, following the Vertical Slice layout for .NET and the module headers for `.sandcastle/`.
   - **Tests**: what the tester should pin for each acceptance criterion, and where.
   - **Risks**: what could go wrong, what to watch for, and anything the issue leaves open that you decided.
2. Write no production code, no tests and no stubs. The tester and the developers write those from your note.
3. Commit an ADR under `docs/adr/` only for a decision that is all three of: hard to reverse, surprising to a reader of the code, and a real trade-off between options. Most
   issues need none. Follow the existing ADRs' numbering and format: what was decided and why, then `## Considered Options`. Lint it with
   `pnpm exec markdownlint-cli2 <file>`, and commit it with `docs(adr): <Summary>`. Name the ADR in the design note.

# RULES

{{SHARED_RULES}}

Once the design note is written, and the ADR committed if there is one, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>.

# FINAL RULES

ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE TASK.
