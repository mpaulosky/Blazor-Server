// by" line the gate reads (lib/gate.mts#bodyBlockers) rather than as native

// posted. A failure marking the issue leaves it unjudged, with nothing
// created, and the mark is taken back off in case GitHub added it anyway. Any
// failure after that hands it back with sandcastle:needs-human, even before
// the first child exists: a create that GitHub answered with an error may
// still have created the child. When the hand-back fails too, the marks still
// keep the issue and its children out of intake (#234).
