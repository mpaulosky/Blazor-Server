// Follow-up sweep
//
// Nothing acted on a Sandcastle PR once it was open: it could fall behind
// main, miss its Copilot review, or close without merging while its issue
// stayed open. Each round, before intake, the host sweeps every open,
// non-draft, same-repo PR into main from a matching issue branch that it
// itself published (see isSandcastlePullRequest), and acts on the ones that
// need no agent: re-requesting a stale Copilot review, updating a branch
// that's only behind main, and handing an issue back when its latest PR
// closed without merging. A PR that needs more than that (DIRTY, a red
// check, an unresolved bot thread) is logged here and returned as a
// PassTarget: the agent pass that fixes it lives in lib/follow-up-pass.mts
// (#78).
