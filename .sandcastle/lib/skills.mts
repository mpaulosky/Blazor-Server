// The .NET skills live in the host user's ~/.claude/skills, not in the repo,

// only, into the sandbox user's ~/.claude/skills. A skill there is usually a
// symlink into a dotfiles checkout, which a mount of the folder wouldn't
// follow, so each skill's real path is mounted on its own.
//
// Every sandbox also gets .git/config and .git/hooks read-only, over
// Sandcastle's read-write mount of the shared .git directory, so no agent can
// plant a command there for the host's git to run (see lib/host-safety.mts).
// Those two go in through the provider's create(), not docker({ mounts }):
// docker() refuses a file mount outside /home/agent, and .git/config is one.
