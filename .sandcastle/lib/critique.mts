// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Plan critique
//
// A second run after the planner checks one thing: whether the round's picks
// are safe to build in parallel, meaning no file or module overlap between
// them, and none depending on an API or decision another open issue will
// establish. Its only power is to defer a pick. The host saves each deferral
// as a native "blocked by" link, so the blocker gate holds the issue back
// until its blocker lands, and a human overrides it by deleting the link.
