// Schema validator works just as well — Valibot, ArkType, etc. See
// https://standardschema.dev. There's no branch field: the host names branches
// (see branchFor), so a re-plan can't move an issue's work to a new branch.
// `roles` is left as unknown rather than validated here: an invalid value
// (not an array, or naming a role resolveRoles doesn't recognise) must fall
// back to every optional role, not abort the whole plan the way a schema
// mismatch would (see "Phase 4: Plan" in docs/plans/sandcastle-workflow.md).
