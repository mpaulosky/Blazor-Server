# CONTEXT

A planner has picked the issues below to build in parallel this round, each on its own branch from `main`.

The picked issues:

<picked-json>

{{PICKED_JSON}}

</picked-json>

The in-flight issues. Each one already has an open pull request waiting for review; `files` lists the paths that PR changes:

<in-flight-json>

{{IN_FLIGHT_JSON}}

</in-flight-json>

The ready issues the planner didn't pick this round:

<unpicked-json>

{{UNPICKED_JSON}}

</unpicked-json>

The repository is checked out in your working directory at `main`. Read it to see which files and modules each issue would change.

# TASK

Check whether the picked issues are safe to build in parallel. Check only these two things:

1. **Overlap.** A pick would change the same files or modules as another pick, or as an in-flight issue's pull request, so the branches would likely conflict.
2. **Dependency.** A pick needs an API, a type, a file or a decision that another open issue (a pick, an in-flight issue or an unpicked ready issue) will establish, so building it now
   would mean guessing at that work.

Don't judge anything else: not whether an issue is well written, too big, worth doing, or ordered well. Those aren't your concern.

Your only power is to **defer** a pick. A deferred pick waits until the issue it's deferred behind lands. You can't add, reorder, merge or rewrite issues.

When two picks overlap, keep one and defer the other behind it. Prefer to keep the pick the other depends on, and otherwise the smaller one. Never defer both picks of a pair behind each
other. When a pick overlaps an in-flight issue, defer it behind that in-flight issue. When in doubt, keep the pick: a needless deferral costs a round, and the pre-push gate still
catches a real conflict.

# OUTPUT

Give one verdict per picked issue, as a JSON object wrapped in `<critique>` tags:

<critique>
{"verdicts": [{"id": "42", "verdict": "keep", "reason": "Touches only the Theme feature; no other issue does."}, {"id": "43", "verdict": "defer", "blockedBy": "42", "reason": "Both change Features/Theme/ThemeService.cs."}]}
</critique>

- `id` is the picked issue's number, as a string.
- `verdict` is `keep` or `defer`.
- `blockedBy` is required for `defer` and left out for `keep`. It is the number, as a string, of the open issue the pick must wait for. Name an issue, never a pull request: for an in-flight
  issue, use its `number`, not its `pr`.
- `reason` is one or two sentences naming the overlapping files or modules, or the API or decision the pick depends on. The host posts it on the deferred issue, so write it for the
  person who reads it there.

Always emit the `<critique>` tags.
