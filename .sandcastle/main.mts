// Parallel Planner with Review — plan → execute → review → PR loop
//
// This template drives a multi-phase workflow:
//   Phase 0 (Housekeeping):     Two steps that need no agent. First the
//                               follow-up sweep (lib/follow-up.mts): for each
//                               open PR the host published for an in-scope
//                               issue, it re-requests a Copilot review that
//                               never came, updates a settled PR that's only
//                               behind main on GitHub, and logs one that needs
//                               a follow-up pass; and it hands back an issue
//                               whose latest PR closed without merging. Then
//                               the host closes as completed every umbrella
//                               (an issue intake split) whose sub-issues have
//                               all closed as completed (lib/umbrella.mts).
//                               Then the early exit (lib/work.mts): with no
//                               issue for intake, no ready unblocked issue and
//                               no PR that needs a follow-up pass, the run
//                               exits 0 before any sandbox or agent starts.
//   Phase 0a (Intake):          One run judges every open issue that carries
//                               none of sandcastle:ready, sandcastle:needs-info
//                               and sandcastle:needs-human against the
//                               Definition of Ready (intake-prompt.md). The
//                               host adds sandcastle:ready, or hands the issue
//                               back with sandcastle:needs-info and numbered
//                               questions, or splits an issue too big for one
//                               PR into blocked child issues and turns it into
//                               an umbrella, and adds bug when the verdict says
//                               so (lib/intake.mts).
//   Phase 0b (Gate):            The host resolves each open issue's blockers
//                               (GitHub "blocked by" links and "Blocked by #N"
//                               / "Depends on #N" lines) and holds back every
//                               issue whose blocker hasn't landed yet, that
//                               already has an open PR, that another run is
//                               building (sandcastle:building), that intake
//                               hasn't marked sandcastle:ready, or that's
//                               handed back (sandcastle:needs-info or
//                               sandcastle:needs-human).
//   Phase 1 (Plan):             The planner analyzes the ready issues, builds
//                               a dependency graph, and outputs a <plan> JSON
//                               listing unblocked issues.
//   Phase 1b (Critique):        A second run checks whether the picks are safe
//                               to build in parallel and defers the ones that
//                               aren't behind a native "blocked by" link. The
//                               host names each remaining pick's branch and
//                               fetches it if it exists.
//   Phase 2 (Execute + Review): For each issue, a sandbox is created via
//                               createSandbox(), and the issue carries
//                               sandcastle:building until its build ends,
//                               however it ends. The architect, when the
//                               planner picked it, writes a design note the
//                               host posts on the issue. The tester commits
//                               failing tests, then the backend developer and,
//                               when picked, the UI developer make them pass;
//                               if any of these fails, the issue stops for the
//                               round. If the branch is then ahead of main (this
//                               run's commits or earlier ones), the host runs
//                               scripts/gate.sh in the sandbox (checkpoint 1),
//                               the scribe (when picked) documents the change,
//                               a reviewer runs, and the gate runs again
//                               (checkpoint 2). A red gate gets two gate-fixer
//                               attempts per checkpoint; past that nothing is
//                               pushed. A red checkpoint or a failed architect,
//                               tester, backend or UI run is a failed build
//                               attempt: the first gets a comment, the second
//                               hands the issue back with sandcastle:needs-human
//                               (lib/handback.mts). A failed scribe or reviewer
//                               still publishes, with a note in the PR.
//                               Otherwise the host scans the commits for the
//                               sandbox's secrets, pushes the commit the gate
//                               passed on from the main checkout with git hooks
//                               off, and opens a pull request that closes its
//                               issue (lib/host-safety.mts). All issue
//                               pipelines run concurrently via
//                               Promise.allSettled().
//
// The outer loop repeats up to MAX_ITERATIONS times so that newly unblocked
// issues are picked up after each round. The loop stops early when a round
// opens no pull request, but not when the critique defers every pick.
//
// The run also stops cleanly, exiting 0, once it can't finish more work
// (lib/limits.mts, #147): no new round or role run starts after
// SANDCASTLE_BUDGET_MINUTES (default 240) have passed since it started, and
// once a role run hits Claude's usage or rate limit nothing more starts or
// publishes. Neither counts as a failed build attempt; the branches keep
// their commits for the next run.
//
// Every role's model, effort, iteration cap and timeout comes from ROLE_AGENTS
// in lib/config.mts. The sandbox gets no GitHub token: the host reads GitHub
// with its own gh auth and passes each role what it needs through its prompt.
//
// Every phase reads the queue through lib/queue.mts#loadQueue, scoped to the
// run's queue (lib/config.mts#queueScopeFrom): in GitHub Actions every issue
// labelled Sandcastle, and locally only the issue or label the command line
// names. Within it, an issue reaches the phases only when the repository
// owner added its queue label and nobody else has edited it since; anything
// else is skipped and logged. An untrusted sandcastle:ready is removed, and
// a hand-back label someone else removed is put back (#146).
//
// Usage:
//   SANDCASTLE_ISSUE=<n> pnpm run sandcastle         (only issue #n and its PR)
//   SANDCASTLE_LABEL=<label> pnpm run sandcastle     (the issues labelled <label>, e.g. Sandcastle:dev)
