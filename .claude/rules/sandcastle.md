# Sandcastle Rules

`.sandcastle/` is the unattended agent pipeline: TypeScript run with `tsx` on Node, no build step. The design and the
plan of record are in `docs/plans/sandcastle-workflow.md`; each module's header comment says what it owns.
`pnpm run check:sandcastle` (type-check, then every `*.test.mts`) is the check, and `scripts/gate.sh` runs it when these
files change.

## Writing the code

- **Match the module you're in.** Two-space indents, double quotes, semicolons, `.mts` files that import each other with
  the `.mts` extension. `.editorconfig` has no `.mts` section, so the surrounding code is the style guide.
- **Comment the why.** Every exported function and type gets a `//` comment above it in full sentences: what it's for,
  the case it guards against, the incident behind it (`#149`, a request ID). Inside a function, comment only a decision a
  reader would question.
- **Inject the outside world.** A module that touches git, `gh`, Docker, the clock or the filesystem takes it through a
  host object (`BuildHost` in `lib/build.mts`, `SandboxHost` in `lib/skills.mts`) or through parameters with live
  defaults (`publish` in `lib/build.mts`). The live wiring sits at the bottom of the module; tests pass stubs.
- **Keep dependencies where they are.** `package.json` holds Sandcastle, `zod`, the type-checker and `tsx`. Reach for
  Node's standard library first, and justify any new package in the PR description.
- **Fail closed.** When the code can't tell whether something is safe (an unexpected shape from Sandcastle, an
  unreadable GitHub response), throw or hold the issue back rather than carry on.

## Testing

- Tests sit beside the module as `<module>.test.mts`, written with `node:test` (`describe`, `it`) and
  `node:assert/strict`. No mocking library: stubs are object literals that record their calls.
- Name each test as the behaviour it pins, in plain words (`"retries a push that fails with a GitHub server error"`).
- A test that reads a repo file resolves it from `import.meta.url`, as `lib/role-prompts.test.mts` does.

## Host safety

Agents write the worktree and the shared `.git` directory, and the host later runs git and `gh` over both. These
guardrails keep agent-written code from running on the host. A change keeps every one of them:

- Host git runs with hooks off and `GIT_COMMON_DIR` pinned (`lib/host-safety.mts`), in the main checkout only.
- Each sandbox mounts `.git/config` and `.git/hooks` read-only through the provider's `create()` (`lib/skills.mts`).
- The sandbox gets no GitHub token (`main.mts` refuses one in `.sandcastle/.env`); the host does every GitHub write.
- The host pushes the commit the gate passed on, after the secret scan (`lib/scan.mts`), and posts only
  `publicErrorText` on public issues.

The unit tests stub Docker, so they can't see what Sandcastle or Docker does with a mount or option: a stubbed test
passed while every real run failed (#194). When a change touches a mount, the sandbox provider or how the host runs
git, say in the commit body and the PR description that it needs a run against a real sandbox before merging.
